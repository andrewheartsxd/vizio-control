# vizio-control

`vizio-control` is an app lets you wake and sleep your Vizio Smart TV. It can be set to run based on Windows [System Power Management Events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/power/system-power-management-events#power-setting-change-events), allowing you to turn your display on/off automatically when you wake/sleep your PC.

### Rationale
I wrote this because my Vizio Smart TV is connected to my Windows media PC and I got tired of waking/sleeping the PC with my wireless keyboard and then having to use a separate TV remote to turn on/off my TV. Now, I simply hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, Windows starts up, and my TV automatically turns on ðŸ˜Ž. 

### Requirements
- Node `>= v16.13.2`
